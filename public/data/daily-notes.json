    "content": "2026-02-12\n\nFull Day Session (1:28 AM - ongoing)\n\nFINAL Model Configuration (updated 1:50 PM)\n**Primary**: Opus 4.6 (anthropic/claude-opus-4-6) — Anthropic Max subscription ($100 plan, confirmed)\n**Thinking**: HIGH (currently) — see Thinking Strategy below\n**Fallback 1**: GPT-5.1 Codex Mini (openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini) — Codex sub (cheapest)\n**Fallback 2**: GPT-5.2 (openai-codex/gpt-5.2) — Codex sub\n**Fallback 3**: GPT-5.1 (openai-codex/gpt-5.1) — Codex sub\n**Coding sub-agents**: GPT-5.3-Codex (added to allowed models 1:49 PM, works for sub-agents)\n**Heartbeat**: Haiku, 1hr interval\n**FULLY PURGED**: OpenRouter, MiniMax, Moonshot, DeepSeek — all removed from config AND auth-profiles AND agent models.json\n**Only providers remaining**: anthropic (Opus), openai-codex (fallbacks/coding), google (embeddings)\n\nThinking Strategy (IMPORTANT — discussed at length with Aviel)\n**Default**: Keep thinking at MEDIUM for most tasks\n**HIGH**: Business strategy, pricing, MIS architecture, complex coding, debugging — or when Aviel says \"think hard\"\n**LOW**: Simple config changes, status checks, quick answers\n**Aviel's preference**: Wants AUTOMATIC switching based on message complexity (not manual)\n**Current approach**: I (Opus) classify each message and decide thinking level myself. Don't pause to ask — just handle it. Only flag Aviel if answer might be wrong without deeper thinking.\n**Future goal**: Build a message classifier pre-hook that reads message first, sets thinking level, then routes to Opus. Not built yet.\n**Key insight from Aviel**: \"I don't want you to get dumber as the session goes on\" — usage-based tiers rejected in favor of task-based classification\n\nToken Conservation System (discussed 10:24 AM - 12:58 PM)\n**Fallback logging**: When Opus hits 429 rate limit, switch to Codex mini and log all work in workspace/logs/opus-fallback.log\n**Log format**: timestamp, model, task, outcome, files_touched, decisions_made, user_requests, open_questions, opus_review_prompt, cost_notes\n**Handoff**: When Opus returns, feed it the log with \"how could this have been better while saving tokens?\"\n**Monitor**: Watch for 429 errors stopping = Opus is back. Send Telegram reminder if user hasn't noticed.\n**Auto-switch back**: When 429s stop, restore Opus as primary automatically\n**All monitoring/reminders use cheapest model** (Codex mini on OpenAI sub, no API cost)\n\nClaude Anthropic Usage (CRITICAL — updated 12:58 PM)\n**Plan**: Max $100/month (confirmed via screenshot). Aviel considering $200 upgrade.\n**Session limit**: Resets every ~5 hours\n**Weekly limit**: 74% used as of 11:54 AM. Resets Monday 1:00 PM ET.\n**Sonnet**: 0% used. Resets Wed 12:00 PM.\n**Extra usage**: Was ON at $5.62/$5 limit (112%). Aviel turned it OFF.\n**Current balance**: $62.19 (auto-reload off)\n**Burn rate**: ~7% session usage per 2-3 exchanges on high thinking. ~28 exchanges per session on high, ~70-80 on medium.\n**Session reset screenshot (11:04 AM)**: 0% session, confirmed reset works\n**Session at 11:54 AM**: 7% used already from ~3 Opus exchanges with high thinking\n\nAvailable OpenAI Codex Models (all via Codex OAuth sub)\nopenai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini — cheapest, simple tasks\nopenai-codex/gpt-5.1 — light research\nopenai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-max — coding\nopenai-codex/gpt-5.2 — complex tasks\nopenai-codex/gpt-5.2-codex — heavy coding\nopenai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex — newest/most capable\n\nProvider Cleanup (CRITICAL FIX — 1:10 PM)\n**Root cause of recurring \"API billing error\" in Telegram**: OpenClaw bug #12022 — false positive pattern matching\nOpenClaw scans assistant RESPONSE TEXT for words like \"billing\" + \"upgrade\" + \"plan\"\nIf found, replaces the entire response with a fake billing error warning\nThis was triggered every time I mentioned the $200 account change\n**Workaround**: Avoid using those trigger words together in responses\n**Secondary cause**: Dead providers (MiniMax, OpenRouter, Moonshot, DeepSeek) in hidden ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/models.json file\nThis file is SEPARATE from openclaw.json and was still loaded by the gateway\nContained API keys for providers with no funds\nDuring Opus 429 failover, OpenClaw tried these dead providers → billing errors\n**Fixed**: Wiped models.json to {\"providers\":{}}\n**Also removed**: minimax:default from auth-profiles.json (profile + usageStats + lastGood)\n**Billing backoff**: Set auth.cooldowns.billingBackoffHours: 24\n**Only providers remaining**: anthropic (Opus), openai-codex (Codex sub), google (embeddings)\n\nTools Configured\n**Brave Search API**: [REDACTED] at tools.web.search.apiKey\n**YouTube transcript tool**: youtube-transcript-api v1.2.4 (python3)\n**OpenClaw version**: 2026.2.9\n\nAlex Finn Transcripts — COMPLETE\n**11 transcripts saved**: ~/.openclaw/workspace/transcripts/\n**55,903 words total**\n**Analysis files**:\ntranscripts/alex-finn-analysis.md (21.9 KB)\ntranscripts/alex-finn-action-items.md (11.7 KB)\ntranscripts/batch1-details.md (~19 KB)\ntranscripts/batch2-details.md (~19 KB)\n\nKey Action Items from Alex Finn (filtered for Aviel)\n**Already done**: OpenClaw local ✅, Telegram ✅, brain dump ✅, morning brief ✅, model routing ✅, heartbeat ✅, Kanban ✅, memory flush ✅\n**This week**: Enable session memory search, deeper brain dump, reverse prompting, custom skills\n**Skip**: VPS, Mac Mini, X API, local models, YouTube thumbnails\n\nADHD Communication Rule (CRITICAL)\n**ONE thing per day** — never send overwhelming lists\n**I manage my own backlog** — user doesn't see full list\n**Morning brief = daily guide** — one task, why it matters, permission to ignore rest\nUser got anxious from big list — don't repeat this mistake\n\nKanban Boards (SPLIT into 2 — done 1:50 PM)\n**Work Board**: ~/.openclaw/workspace/kanban/work.html\nWindows: file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-24.04/home/inkredible/.openclaw/workspace/kanban/work.html\nStorage key: kanban_work_v1\n4 columns: Backlog, In Progress, ChetGPT Active, Done\nIndigo accent (#6366f1), tags: setup/scraping/research/MIS/infra\n37 tasks including MIS phases, NDF scraping, infra\n\n**Personal Board**: ~/.openclaw/workspace/kanban/personal.html\nWindows: file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-24.04/home/inkredible/.openclaw/workspace/kanban/personal.html\nStorage key: kanban_personal_v1\n4 columns: Backlog, This Week, In Progress, Done\nAmber accent (#f59e0b), tags: personal/family/health/finance/home\n10 personal tasks from TickTick\n**Aviel said personal board is JUST AS IMPORTANT as work** — he's leaning too much toward work and it's affecting personal life\n\n**Old board** (index.html) still exists but is superseded by the split boards.\nBoth boards link to each other via nav buttons\nBoth built by Codex 5.3 sub-agent\n**TODO**: Deploy BOTH to GitHub Pages for phone access\n\nMorning Brief Cron\nFires at 8 AM ET Mon-Fri\nChrome Extension Relay not connected — falls back to Kanban task list\nSent Canada shipment as today's ONE task\n\nFile Transfer\nOneDrive IS accessible from WSL at /mnt/c/Users/inkre/OneDrive/Desktop/\nUser has MD files (SOPs, operations) on other computer to share\nRecommended: Send via Telegram (fastest) or OneDrive folder\n\nMIS Project Plan (THE MAIN PROJECT — discussed 12:53 PM)\nAviel wants this to be the #1 priority. Everything else feeds into it.\n\n**Phase 1: Get data into OpenClaw** (Aviel's next action)\nCopy INKredible Extractor app source to workspace\nCopy vendor PDF invoices to workspace\nAviel needs to tell me the file paths on Windows machine\nCommand will be: cp -r /mnt/c/Users/inkre/path-to-extractor/ ~/.openclaw/workspace/extractor/\n\n**Phase 2: Background work (I do this, Aviel does other stuff)**\nRead Extractor code, understand cost calculation logic\nTest against PDFs, verify output matches what Aviel sees\nScrape remaining 8 NDF products (Business Cards, Flyers, Brochures, Booklets, Folded Cards, Tags, Die Cut, Menus)\nUse Codex 5.3 sub-agent for scraping while Opus handles architecture\n\n**Phase 3: Build pricing engine (we design together)**\nReal costs (Extractor) + NDF anchor = three-tier pricing for every product\nWeb app: type in job → see cost, opening price, target price, floor price\n\n**Phase 4: Inventory + MIS**\nFIFO lot tracking\nConnect inventory to pricing (actual current material cost per job)\n\n**Coding model**: Codex GPT-5.3 (openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex) — newest, best for coding, included in Codex sub\n\nThinking Level Test (12:33 PM — PASSED)\nAviel tested the classifier concept: sent complex MIS/Extractor message\nI correctly classified it as HIGH thinking needed\nAviel confirmed \"you passed, you guessed it right\"\nThis validates the task-based classification approach\n\nGitHub Setup (discussed 1:50 PM)\nAviel wants to set up GitHub for: deploying Kanban to Pages + hosting INKredible Extractor\nNo special skill needed — git is installed, can use GitHub REST API\n**Waiting on**: Aviel to confirm if he has a GitHub account or needs to create one\n**Next step**: Aviel creates Personal Access Token (repo scope) → I store it → create repos → deploy\n\nMorning Brief Update\nShould include ONE personal item alongside the work i"
