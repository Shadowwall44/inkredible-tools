    "content": "INKredible Printing Team Meeting\nDate: February 9, 2026\nParticipants: Aviel Samucha (Owner), Brandon Lewis (COO)\nDuration: ~34 minutes\nPriority: HIGH\n\nFull Transcript\n[Saved from Aviel's message — see original for full text]\n\nKey Themes\n\n1. Aviel's ADHD & Self-Awareness\nTherapist confirmed extreme ADHD symptoms\nHyperfocus on AI/tools instead of business operations\nRecognizes pattern: can't stop, blocks out family/people, guilt cycle\nConsidering psychiatrist + low-dose medication\n\"If I don't fix this, it's a me problem\"\n\n2. Brandon's Anxiety & Concerns\nFears his hard work is \"fueling instability\"\nWorried about cash management: $13K in owner withdrawals (Dec-Jan)\nDoesn't want to overstep but needs to speak honestly\nFeels business operations are strong but financial management isn't matching\n\n3. Cash Flow Issues\nUnpaid invoices: Hadad, two Messy Laws\nCelia's check — possibly lost (left in car)\nCash not being funneled into business account (tax avoidance concern)\nOne credit card getting overloaded instead of spreading across 2-3\n$6K in expenses (graphics event + dry cat) couldn't be offset because cash wasn't deposited\nBrandon's point: if everyone paid and withdrawals were lower, account could be at $33-50K\n\n4. Business Health (Positive)\nRevenue growing since Aug 2025 restructuring (after Shai left)\nMore stable operations — orders on time, fewer mistakes\nBetter job mix: more floor graphics, fabric (higher margin, less labor)\nNow Graphics partnership — lower margin but fills capacity\nClaude analysis: business at 1.5x metric (sales/expenses), needs 2.0x\nBrandon feels company is in \"100 times better place\" than before\n\n5. Brandon's Relationship to the Company\n\"I love the company almost as if it's my company\"\nAviel: \"You're not a worker. You're family.\"\nBrandon doesn't want to leave\nNeeds to feel his hard work translates to stability\n\n6.

    "content": "41_TNGDDnfQ — INKredible Action Plan (Nightly Summary)\n\nSource transcript reviewed: transcripts/41_TNGDDnfQ.md\n\nWhat matters for INKredible (not generic creator stuff)\n\n1) Brain dump first (highest leverage)\nThe video repeats this as the #1 workflow. For INKredible, this unlocks better daily prioritization and less task thrash.\n\n**Implementation for Aviel:**\nRun one focused brain-dump session (business + personal constraints + goals + stress points)\nSave to memory/ as structured notes\nUse it to drive morning brief priorities automatically\n\n2) Goal-driven daily task generation (already partially in place)\nThis maps directly to current Kanban + morning brief setup.\n\n**Gap to close:**\nMorning brief should be generated from explicit priorities/goals (not only static tasks)\nInclude one business task + one personal task by default\n\n3) Second brain / memory browsing\nCore memory exists, but retrieval UX is still mostly chat-driven.\n\n**Practical next step (small):**\nBuild a lightweight index page that lists recent memory/*.md notes and links to key summaries (no heavy app needed yet)\n\n4) Proactive overnight work (already live)\nNightly cron exists and is useful. Biggest value now is quality control: work logs + structured output Aviel can scan in 2 minutes.\n\n**Standard output format for overnight runs:**\nWhat was done\nWhat changed (files)\nWhat is blocked\nWhat needs Aviel input\nOne recommended next action\n\n5) “Replace SaaS with custom tools” — apply selectively\nThis is useful only when the custom tool clearly saves time/money.\n\n**Good candidates now:**\nQuote drafting app (already queued)\nExtraction QA dashboard (coverage, failures, high-value material rows)\n\n**Not worth building now:**\nFull calendar/todo replacement before MIS fundamentals are stable\n\nRecommended priority order for next work blocks\n1. Brain dump session (critical dependency)\n2. QuickBooks exports into ChetGPT (financial visibility)\n3. Quote drafting app v1 (separate app, not in Kanban)\n4. Extraction QA dashboard / report automation\n\nFast morning briefing draft (for later send)\nOvernight takeaway: transcript reinforces that brain dump + goal-driven daily task generation are the highest ROI workflows.\nRecommendation: schedule one focused brain-dump session first, then use it to auto-generate better daily priorities.\nBuild next: quote tool + extraction QA view (both directly tied to MIS and profit visibility)."

Go check my repos… clean up code… build this feature… tackle bugs…”\n**Build a Kanban/task board to manage the bot**:\nPrompt pattern: “Build a Kanban board that tracks our tasks so I can assign you work and monitor progress.”\n**Dedicated email workflow**:\nCreate a dedicated Gmail; then **forward/CC** emails to the bot with instructions like “respond/schedule/remind/do the tasks mentioned.”\n**“Second brain” file system**:\nAsk it to create folders/categories (examples used): **ideas**, **inbox**, **research**.\nGoal stated: replace Notion to avoid paying for it.\n**Overnight build habit**:\nNightly prompt the speaker uses: **“Build something cool for me tonight.”**\n\n---\n\nVideo: UTCi_q6iuCM — “How to make ClawdBot 10x better (5 easy steps)”\nURL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=UTCi_q6iuCM\n\n1) Memory upgrades: two settings OFF by default\nTwo memory features named as **off by default**:\n**Memory flush**\n**Session memory search**\nProblem described: after automatic **memory compactions**, it may “forget what it said 5 seconds ago.”\nAction to implement (as stated): paste the creator’s **prompt** (provided “down below” in the video description) to enable both.\n**What Memory flush does (per transcript):** right *before* compaction it records the most important parts so they survive the compaction.\n**What Session memory search does (per transcript):** lets the bot **search conversation history** when it doesn’t remember something.\n\n2) Model routing: “brain” vs “muscles” (explicit model-to-task mapping)\nCore concept: use **Opus 45 as the brain** (conversation + orchestration) but route specialized tasks to better “muscles.”\nSpecific recommendations:\n**Coding muscle:** **Codex (CLI)**\n**Web search muscle:** **Gemini (API)**\n**Social/X search muscle:** **Grok (API)**\nExact instruction pattern to give your bot (quoted structure from transcript):\n“Moving forward, use **Codex CLI** for all coding. Use the **Gemini API** for all web search. Use the **Grok API** for all social search.”\nSetup flow described: it will ask for **API keys**; you provide them; it configures and remembers.\n\n3) “Brain dump” + expectation setting (to trigger proactive behavior)\nAction:\nSpend ~**10 minutes** telling it your goals, workflow, ambitions, relationships, hobbies.\nExpectation setting (explicit):\nTell it you want it to be **proactive** and do work **overnight while you sleep**, so you wake up “surprised” by progress.\n\n4) Reverse prompting (exact technique + example prompts)\nReverse prompting definition: instead of telling it tasks, ask it what it needs / what it should do.\nExample prompts given:\n“Based on what you know about me and my goals, what tasks can you do to get us closer to our missions?”\n“What other information can I provide you to improve our productivity?”\n\n5) Have it build internal tooling (examples explicitly shown)\nAsk it: “What tooling can we build to improve our productivity?”\nConcrete tools it built (as described):\nA **task board** with columns: **backlog / working on / reviewed** plus activity history.\nA **document viewer** to browse “memories and tasks.”\nMentions layering more: **project board, memory board, captures, people, CRM**.\nImplementation instruction:\nAfter installing **Codex** as coding muscle, ask: “What tools could you build so we can be more productive together?”\n\n---\n\nVideo: lxfakTpdz1Y — “How to run ClawdBot for DIRT CHEAP”\nURL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=lxfakTpdz1Y\n\nKey cost trap + fix: the heartbeat\nFact in transcript: OpenClaw has a **heartbeat every 10 minutes** that checks for tasks.\nDefault behavior: it uses your **brain model** for that heartbeat.\nCost estimate the speaker claims:\nIf heartbeat uses **Opus 45**: **~$2/day** ⇒ **~$54/month** wasted.\nActionable fixes:\n 1) **Switch heartbeat model to Claude Haiku** (speaker says it’s enough compute for monitoring).\nClaimed new cost: **~$0.10/day**.\n 2) **Increase heartbeat interval** from **every 10 minutes → every hour**.\nClaimed cost at hourly: **~$0.01/day**.\n\nModel routing recommendations by use-case (brain + muscles)\n**Brain model**\n“Best regardless of cost”: **Opus 45**.\n“Cheapest brain with near-Opus vibe”: **Kimmy K2.5**.\nNotes: “specials” where you can get **~a month basically free**.\n**Coding**\nBest (no cost concern): **Codex GPT 5.2 “extra high”** via **CLI**.\nInstruction pattern: “Use Codex GPT 5.2 extra high whenever you code (via CLI).”\nCheapest: **MiniMax 2.1**.\nClaimed pricing: **~$1/week** (mentions “coding specific plan”).\nClaimed savings: avoids **~$250/month** “Codex Pro plan on ChatGPT.”\n**Web crawling / browser automation**\nBest: **Opus 45**.\nCheap alternative: **DeepSeek V3** (specifically for “controlling the browser / crawling the web”).\n**Writing content**\nBest: **Opus 45** (warm personality).\nCheap: **Kimmy K2.5** (closest personality among cheaper models).\n**Voice**\nRecommended voice model: **“Chat GBT40 real time”** (OpenAI **Realtime API**).\nAction: ask the bot to set it up; you need an **OpenAI platform API key**.\nUse-case: send/receive **voice notes via Telegram**, and bot can also set up phone-number calling wo"

Tell your bot: “create an AI agent that every half hour hits the X API and finds trending tweets on <topic> and alerts me in a new Discord channel.”\n 2. **Sign up for X API**, add a **credit card**, obtain a **bearer token** (he calls it the API key), and give that to the bot.\n\nStrong warning: don’t use X scrapers / unofficial tooling\nHe explicitly warns **NOT** to use skills/services that:\nscrape X instead of using the official API\nrely on “**scrapers and CLIs and O tokens**” instead of official X API\nReasons he gives:\nX “aggressively hates” bypassing the API\nhe knows people who got accounts suspended\nhe knows businesses “sued by X lawyers”\nsaving “$3 a month” isn’t worth risking your account/brand\n\nStrong warning: don’t use (most) skill marketplaces\nHe says he **does not recommend “Claude Hub”** / skills marketplaces, claiming they’re easily compromised.\nHis recommended alternative: **have your OpenClaw learn and write the skill itself** (e.g., “learn how to make thumbnails… then create your own skill for it”).\n\nVPS warning + local-first recommendation (security + integration)\nHe says after testing, **local is significantly better than VPS** and that VPS is often not secure-by-default.\nSpecific security example he cites:\n**Amazon EC2 not secure by default**\nclaims there are “lists of thousands of servers that are exposed” and suggests searching X for: **“Amazon EC2 openclaw exposed”**.\nLocal integration example he uses:\nOpenClaw asked for pictures to train a local image model; he **AirDropped** a folder of photos to the Mac Studio; OpenClaw immediately processed them and trained.\n\nPrompt-injection/permissions warning (Discord)\nWhen asked about Discord bot risk: he says **don’t let other people in your Discord**.\nRecommendation: **personal Discord server only**; don’t let anyone else interact with your OpenClaw because it has admin access to your computer.\n\nMigration between devices (Mac ↔ PC)\nHe states migration is **“extremely easy”** because OpenClaw is “a bunch of markdown files.”\nConcrete migration method he used:\nmoved from Mac Mini → Mac Studio by **AirDropping the folder**; agent “shows up” on the new machine after copy.\n\nScript factory improvement loop (explicit feedback mechanism)\nQuill posts scripts; he **reacts with ✅ or ❌**.\nHe claims the reaction triggers saving to memory files:\n✅ means “liked” → saves what he liked\n❌ means “didn’t like” → saves what he didn’t like\nGoal: subsequent scripts automatically adjust to preferences.\n\nLocal thumbnail pipeline details\nPixel thumbnail agent:\nhe gave it a folder of **71 thumbnail images** of himself\nit **isolated/cut out his face** from all images locally (background removal)\nhe uses that to place his face into new thumbnails.\nFlux customization:\nhe says you can train **a plugin (LoRA-style)** on “**70 pictures**” of yourself so Flux 2.1 can generate thumbnails with your face.\n\nOnboarding / payments command\nTo understand payment/subscription setup, he tells a user to run:\nopenclaw onboard in terminal\nthen choose **ChatGPT** or **Anthropic** during onboarding for subscription usage.\n\n---\n\n2) b-l9sGh1-UY — **5 insane ClawdBot use cases**\nURL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=b-l9sGh1-UY\n\nUse case 1 — Morning brief (scheduled) with concrete prompt\nSchedule: **“every morning at 8 a.m. my time.”**\nPrompt elements he explicitly lists:\nlocal weather\na few **trending YouTube videos** about your interests\ntasks you need to get done today based on your to-do list\ntasks your bot can do today (explicitly asks it to be proactive)\ntrending stories based on your interests\nrecommendations to make today productive\nTool integration:\nConnect to a to-do list app (he uses **Things 3** on Mac).\nFor trending stories: he recommends connecting to the **Brave Search API** for more efficient web search.\n\nUse case 2 — “Proactive coder” that builds while you sleep (scheduled)\nKey instruction: give permission to build without being asked.\nHis explicit constraints:\n“**Just create PRs for me to review.

    "content": "Remaining 3 Transcript Analysis\n\n1. \"Opus 4.6 Upgrade\" (iGkhfUvRV6o)\n\n**Key insights**\nClaude Opus 4.6 brings a 1M-token context window and 128K-token output that dramatically improves memory, long-running reasoning, and the ability to execute very large prompts in one shot.\nAgent swarms/agent teams are now built into Claude Code, spinning up multiple sessions that coordinate through a team lead and exchange context; they need to be enabled explicitly today but can deliver massively parallel work with better token efficiency.\nReverse prompting (asking Claude what it should do next) and explicitly instructing it to leverage overnight/autonomous work unlock new proactive workflows.\n\n**Actionable items**\n1. Implement a dedicated reverse-prompt routine for Claudebot that asks, Based on what you know about me and our past work, how can you take advantage of Opus 4.6 to deliver new workflows?, capture those ideas, and let them steer overnight/autonomous jobs.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (existing features include memory and morning briefs, but we don't yet have this meta-prompt)/\nPriority: ★★★★☆ (High, because it surfaces new, tailored workflows and leverages the new context window without extra manual planning.)\n2. Build a standard overnight/autonomous task process that explicitly tells Claudebot to take advantage of the 1M-token context, reference historical conversations, and report back on progress or deliverables each morning.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (we have morning briefs but not a documented overnight-autonomy protocol tied to the larger context window.)\nPriority: ★★★★☆ (High—this leverages the biggest Opus 4.6 upgrade and could generate more value while we sleep.)\n3. In Claude Code, enable agent teams (not just Codex sub-agents) by running the prompt that edits the settings file, and start prompting tasks with explicit instructions like “please use an agent team” so multiple sessions work in parallel under a team lead that we can query individually.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (we have Codex sub-agents but haven’t enabled the new Claude Code agent team hierarchy yet.)\nPriority: ★★★★★ (Critical—this unlocks much faster and more intelligent code/automation builds.)\n\n---\n\n2. \"Cheapest and Easiest way to set up Claudebot\" (04wh2Hlgbds)\n\n**Key insights**\nA cheap, fully cloud-hosted Claudebot can run on AWS EC2 (C7i flex large, ~30 GB storage) for ~$20/month, eliminating the need to buy dedicated Mac hardware.\nThe most economical model routing is to reuse existing Claude Max/ChatGPT subscriptions or sign up for the ChatGPT API (GPT-5.2 under API key) rather than purchasing new enterprise-grade plans.\nEarly workflows that pay off: an expansive brain dump so memory knows you, setting up a proactive morning brief, asking Claudebot to monitor email daily, and interviewing it about five workflows/tasks it should perform regularly.\n\n**Actionable items**\n1. Create an internal runbook (or automation script) for spinning up a budget-friendly EC2 instance (Ubuntu C7i flex large, 30 GB storage, port 18789 open for SSH) so onboarding new OpenClaw nodes is fast and avoids expensive hardware purchases.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (OpenClaw is running, but we still need a repeatable, documented cheapest deployment path.)\nPriority: ★★★☆☆ (Useful for scaling/fallbacks, but not urgent.)\n2. Formalize connectors for external services (e.g., Gmail) so Claudebot can be told, “Monitor my email and summarize it every evening,” including guidance on securely providing API keys so the agent can manage those integrations.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (we have Telegram/memory/morning brief but no documented email-monitoring connectors yet.)\nPriority: ★★★★☆ (High—expands agent utility and directly implements the example workflow.)\n3. Adopt an “interview Claudebot” prompt that asks, “What are five workflows/tasks you should do for me every day, possibly using connectors or future skills?” and teach the agent to schedule the resulting tasks at set times with a notification channel.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (we use morning briefs but not a systematic interview/scheduling prompt.)\nPriority: ★★★☆☆ (Medium—adds proactive automation but can be rolled out incrementally.)\n\n---\n\n3. \"How to Setup Claude Memory in 5 Mins\" (7eXkrno5KEA)\n\n**Key insights**\nThe Claude Mem (claude-mem) open-source plugin gives Claude Code persistent memory by capturing every tool run, summarizing it, and injecting only the relevant context in new sessions; it saves tokens and lets us search past work.\nIt includes features like progressive disclosure (lightweight indexes first), privacy controls (tags to keep entries out of memory), a local dashboard for history, compressed summaries, and a searchable memory stream.\nSecurity best practices: review the skill’s README before installing, use highlighting (molt worker/Cloudflare) to sandbox OpenClaw, and require verification before granting access.\n\n**Actionable items**\n1. Evaluate and (if compatible with our stack) install the Claude Mem plugin so Claude Code sessions we run through OpenClaw retain architecture decisions, bug fixes, and agent team history; expose the dashboard/search interface for debugging and summaries.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (we already have a memory system, but it doesn’t yet persist Claude Code sessions via this plugin.)\nPriority: ★★★★☆ (High—persistent code memory directly addresses redundant explanations and saves tokens.)\n2. Document a security checklist for installing third-party OpenClaw skills (GitHub review, verifying docs, optional Malt Worker sandbox) whenever we extend OpenClaw with outside code; include the decision process in the onboarding runbook so we don’t skip it.\nAlready done vs new: **New** (best practices are implied but not explicitly codified.)\nPriority: ★★★☆☆ (Medium—important enough to prevent risky installs but not blocking immediate features.)"
