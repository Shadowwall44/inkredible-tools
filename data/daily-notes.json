BIG win.\n 2. **QMD skill** — faster markdown search, fewer tokens\n 3. **Custom skills for repetitive processes** — packaging repeated workflows\n 4. **Autonomy directive** — sharper \"figure it out\" language for AGENTS.md\n**Rejected**: Claw Router — already have custom routing, crypto wallet = red flag, flat-rate plan makes cost savings irrelevant\nAviel appreciated the honest pushback: \"Love how you are thinking and being honest\"\n\nFinancial Dashboard BUILT ✅ (sub-agent ~7:56 AM)\n**LIVE**: https://shadowwall44.github.io/inkredible-tools/dashboard.html\n7 sections: Revenue overview, P&L waterfall, COGS breakdown, Expense breakdown, Red flag alerts, Balance sheet, Key ratios\nOrigin design system, light/dark toggle, mobile-first, glassmorphic panels\nAviel's reaction: \"That dashboard looks amazing!!!\"\n\nQuickBooks Red Flags — ANSWERED by Aviel (7:51 AM)\n1. **Graphic Design $67K = Brandon's pay** — correctly in COGS ✅\n2. **Bank Charges $18.6K = LOC interest (~14%) + credit card interest** — LOC is $43K at ~14% APR, rest is unpaid CC balances. 🔴 Needs refinancing\n3. **Meals $20.8K = mostly personal** — 🔴 IRS audit risk, must separate going forward\n4. **Shipping $41.5K = Messilot account (biggest customer)** — they cover shipping, pass-through ✅\n5. **Salary = $18.4K/yr + distributions** — Aviel doesn't know total distribution amount. Needs QuickBooks Balance Sheet Detail → Equity → Owner's Draw. Instructions sent.\n6. **Donations $13.5K = Jewish tithing (maaser)** — religious obligation. Advised: halachically based on net profit, not gross. Worth recalibrating.\nUpdated analysis: workspace/financials/pnl-analysis.md\n\nQuickBooks API Integration — TOP PRIORITY\nAviel wants live QuickBooks → dashboard connection\nRequires Intuit Developer Portal registration (5 min, Aviel must do)\nSteps sent: developer.intuit.com → sign in → create app → send Client ID + Secret\n**Noon reminder set** (cron ID: 08ec5e3b) for Intuit registration\nAviel marked this \"super top priority\" but Sabbath may prevent today\nI'm pre-building all integration code so it's plug-and-play when he registers\n\nAI Chat Panel for Dashboard — BUILDING (sub-agent dashboard-chat)\nAviel requested embedded AI chatbot in dashboard\nFinancial advisor / accounting expert / QuickBooks expert for printers\nUsing Gemini 2.0 Flash (free tier, API key we already have)\nSystem prompt with all financial data injected as context\nCollapsible chat panel, Origin design, dark/light compatible\nSub-agent spawned, building now\n\nInvoice Extraction — PIVOTED\nAviel will use his own Extractor app (what he built it for)\nWill send Excel export — better than fighting Gemini API quotas\n126 PDFs remaining, his app handles them faster\n\nReminders Set\n**10 AM**: Trump accounts government form (https://form.trumpaccounts.gov/)\n**Noon**: Intuit Developer Portal registration\n\nBrain Dump Round 3\n5 questions sent to Aviel when he asked (7:53 AM):\n 1. Instagram custom builder account\n 2. Good month vs bad month revenue\n 3. Typical workday walkthrough\n 4. Therapy status\n 5.

Stacked bar charts — monthly data, color-coded categories, hover tooltip with full breakdown\n 2. Donut/ring charts — category proportions, click segment → center shows name + $ + %\n 3. Bar/Donut toggle — two icon buttons to switch views\n 4. Summary cards — Total and Avg/mo below charts\n 5. ALL rendered inline in chat bubbles\nUsing Chart.js via CDN for interactive charts\nGemini outputs special chart blocks\nGlassmorphic styling, dark/light mode\nWelcome message auto-loads\n\nAPI Key Bug FIXED ✅\nDashboard chatbot was showing \"API key not valid\" error\nRoot cause: I gave the sub-agent wrong Gemini API key ([REDACTED])\nCorrect key from auth-profiles.json: [REDACTED]\nFixed in dashboard.html, committed, rebuilt, redeployed to gh-pages\n**Lesson**: Always read the actual auth-profiles.json for keys, don't trust compaction summary values\n\nGemini API for Dashboard Chat\nAviel asked which free model API to use\nRecommended: Stay with Gemini 2.0 Flash (already integrated, free tier: 15 req/min, 1M tokens/day)\nRejected: Groq (worse at JSON), Mistral (lower limits), Claude (wastes flat-rate tokens), GPT-4o Mini (costs money)\nKey insight shared: \"Don't overthink the model.

    "content": "2026-02-12\n\nFull Day Session (1:28 AM - ongoing)\n\nFINAL Model Configuration (updated 1:50 PM)\n**Primary**: Opus 4.6 (anthropic/claude-opus-4-6) — Anthropic Max subscription ($100 plan, confirmed)\n**Thinking**: HIGH (currently) — see Thinking Strategy below\n**Fallback 1**: GPT-5.1 Codex Mini (openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini) — Codex sub (cheapest)\n**Fallback 2**: GPT-5.2 (openai-codex/gpt-5.2) — Codex sub\n**Fallback 3**: GPT-5.1 (openai-codex/gpt-5.1) — Codex sub\n**Coding sub-agents**: GPT-5.3-Codex (added to allowed models 1:49 PM, works for sub-agents)\n**Heartbeat**: Haiku, 1hr interval\n**FULLY PURGED**: OpenRouter, MiniMax, Moonshot, DeepSeek — all removed from config AND auth-profiles AND agent models.json\n**Only providers remaining**: anthropic (Opus), openai-codex (fallbacks/coding), google (embeddings)\n\nThinking Strategy (IMPORTANT — discussed at length with Aviel)\n**Default**: Keep thinking at MEDIUM for most tasks\n**HIGH**: Business strategy, pricing, MIS architecture, complex coding, debugging — or when Aviel says \"think hard\"\n**LOW**: Simple config changes, status checks, quick answers\n**Aviel's preference**: Wants AUTOMATIC switching based on message complexity (not manual)\n**Current approach**: I (Opus) classify each message and decide thinking level myself. Don't pause to ask — just handle it. Only flag Aviel if answer might be wrong without deeper thinking.\n**Future goal**: Build a message classifier pre-hook that reads message first, sets thinking level, then routes to Opus. Not built yet.\n**Key insight from Aviel**: \"I don't want you to get dumber as the session goes on\" — usage-based tiers rejected in favor of task-based classification\n\nToken Conservation System (discussed 10:24 AM - 12:58 PM)\n**Fallback logging**: When Opus hits 429 rate limit, switch to Codex mini and log all work in workspace/logs/opus-fallback.log\n**Log format**: timestamp, model, task, outcome, files_touched, decisions_made, user_requests, open_questions, opus_review_prompt, cost_notes\n**Handoff**: When Opus returns, feed it the log with \"how could this have been better while saving tokens?\"\n**Monitor**: Watch for 429 errors stopping = Opus is back. Send Telegram reminder if user hasn't noticed.\n**Auto-switch back**: When 429s stop, restore Opus as primary automatically\n**All monitoring/reminders use cheapest model** (Codex mini on OpenAI sub, no API cost)\n\nClaude Anthropic Usage (CRITICAL — updated 12:58 PM)\n**Plan**: Max $100/month (confirmed via screenshot). Aviel considering $200 upgrade.\n**Session limit**: Resets every ~5 hours\n**Weekly limit**: 74% used as of 11:54 AM. Resets Monday 1:00 PM ET.\n**Sonnet**: 0% used. Resets Wed 12:00 PM.\n**Extra usage**: Was ON at $5.62/$5 limit (112%).

Everything else feeds into it.\n\n**Phase 1: Get data into OpenClaw** (Aviel's next action)\nCopy INKredible Extractor app source to workspace\nCopy vendor PDF invoices to workspace\nAviel needs to tell me the file paths on Windows machine\nCommand will be: cp -r /mnt/c/Users/inkre/path-to-extractor/ ~/.openclaw/workspace/extractor/\n\n**Phase 2: Background work (I do this, Aviel does other stuff)**\nRead Extractor code, understand cost calculation logic\nTest against PDFs, verify output matches what Aviel sees\nScrape remaining 8 NDF products (Business Cards, Flyers, Brochures, Booklets, Folded Cards, Tags, Die Cut, Menus)\nUse Codex 5.3 sub-agent for scraping while Opus handles architecture\n\n**Phase 3: Build pricing engine (we design together)**\nReal costs (Extractor) + NDF anchor = three-tier pricing for every product\nWeb app: type in job → see cost, opening price, target price, floor price\n\n**Phase 4: Inventory + MIS**\nFIFO lot tracking\nConnect inventory to pricing (actual current material cost per job)\n\n**Coding model**: Codex GPT-5.3 (openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex) — newest, best for coding, included in Codex sub\n\nThinking Level Test (12:33 PM — PASSED)\nAviel tested the classifier concept: sent complex MIS/Extractor message\nI correctly classified it as HIGH thinking needed\nAviel confirmed \"you passed, you guessed it right\"\nThis validates the task-based classification approach\n\nGitHub Setup (discussed 1:50 PM)\nAviel wants to set up GitHub for: deploying Kanban to Pages + hosting INKredible Extractor\nNo special skill needed — git is installed, can use GitHub REST API\n**Waiting on**: Aviel to confirm if he has a GitHub account or needs to create one\n**Next step**: Aviel creates Personal Access Token (repo scope) → I store it → create repos → deploy\n\nMorning Brief Update\nShould include ONE personal item alongside the work i"
